Example Run #2 - Program Complete (Toner exits before 3 refills)

(Note: I included code that will make the paper or toner tech stop attempting to refill if it has had 5 attempts without needing to refill, so that if the passengers have finished printing but the number of refills have not been met; the program will be still able to reach a "complete" state, however without this check the paper/toner techs would also get stuck in an infinite loop of checking and waiting like the passenger can (shown in example 1).
